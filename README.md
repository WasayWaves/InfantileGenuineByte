# Blackjack Game in Python

Welcome to our Blackjack game, built entirely in Python! This project aims to provide a simple, console-based version of the classic card game. Whether you're here to study the code or just for fun, we hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed making it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. This game was developed and tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with any version of Python 3.x. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## How to Play

Playing our Blackjack game is simple. Once the game starts, you'll be given two cards, with the dealer taking two cards as well (one face up, the other face down). You can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep your current hand). The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10, Aces can be worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth their face value.

After you stand, the dealer will reveal their hand and decide to hit or stand based on a set of rules. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, or if the dealer busts, you win!

## Features

- Simple, intuitive console-based user interface
- Dealer logic that mimics typical casino rules
- Score tracking for both player and dealer
